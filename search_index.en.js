are happy to announce the huge release of probe-rs 0.11.0 today.\nIt has been a long time coming and is possibly our biggest release so far with over 7 months of development since the last one in November 2020!\nThis release sports a lot of internal improvements, bugfixes and quality of life additions.\nprobe-rs\nMost notable for probe-rs are:\n\nOur flash layout algorithm got a huge overhaul and fixed some issues with ihex files and small data chunks.\nA lot of SWD improvements for J-Link to work better and faster!\nSecure access on chips with TrustZone™ is now possible.\nprobe-rs now makes use of double buffering in the flash process which gives it a decent speed improvement.\nMany papercut fixes and RISC-V support for the GDB server.\nprobe-rs can now perform flash verification after flashing!\nA lot of bugfixes for the ARM Debug Interface.\n\nOn top of that we added support for a multitude of targets!\nMany SAMD, STM32, nRF5x and LPC devices were added or got improvements.\nFor a full list, checkout the changelog on the release page.\ncargo-flash\nFor cargo-flash we improved the error reporting a lot. Before we would display the plain error probe-rs gave us which was not very actionable for the user.\nNow we try to give the user an actionable hint like in the picture below.\n\n\nWe have a whole error/hint catalogue and try to expand this. This feature can easily be ported to other tools such as cargo-embed and probe-run too to ease the development.\ncargo-embed\ncargo-embed got two big quality of life improvements:\n\nRTT and the GDB server can now run concurrently. Previously this was not possible at all. Now you can enable RTT and GDB at the same time. Make sure to put RUST_LOG=off such that the GDB server does not print into the RTT UI. This is of course a bit suboptimal and we are working better ways to use RTT unhindered.\nTypos or non-existant config flags are now spotted and reported to the user, such that things like enable vs enabled do not cost you hours of debugging anymore.\n\nOngoing Work &amp; Behind the Scenes\nVSCode Plugin\nFor a long time our VSCode plugin has been the little loved child on the sidelines. Recently, @noppej has put in serious work to make it properly useable! Unfortunately the additions barely didn't make it into this release, but will most likely be in one of the next ones around the corner.\n\n\nYou can check out the current state in the repo to take a sneak peek.\nWhile running, halting, breaking and stepping works already, stepping only steps single instructions at the moment, which can be tedious.\nThis is being worked on as well as RTT support in the VSCode terminal section! This will be extended in the near future to be a full plugin that also supports RTT down channels as well as an SVD viewer and ITM tracing!\nA proof of concept of the SVD viewer can be seen below.\n\nDebug Sequences\nDebug sequences are ARM's intended way of performing special procedures on targets which deviate from standards (within reason or even violating the spec) to unlock features of different targets which go beyond simple flashing.\nAs many of you might have experienced while using probe-rs, some chips do not work as well as others. Furthermore, some chips do not work at all or lack certain features. Sequences will improve this a lot!\nTo illustrate what sequences will bring to probe-rs, here are a few examples:\n\nSpecial reset needs of SAMD devices will be enabled by sequences, meaning those chips are less troublesome.\nFlashing secure or otherwise special memory portions such as the network core memory of the nRF5340 will be possible with sequences as it allows us to perform special unlock procedures.\nErasing and unlocking protected chips such as the nRF52xxx series is possible with sequences.\nITM tracing and other advanced features can be unlocked and enabled with sequences.\n\nIn short, sequences will enable many new possibilities around different targets that have been difficult until now!\nAnd another cool thing sequences will enable is automatic target detection! No more passing --chip xyz, possible hints of target/architecture mismatch when flashing a miscompiled binary, etc!\nMulticore Support\n@dirbaio and @diondokter have been hard at work to make the handling of multicore MCUs possible.\nThis is entangled somewhat with debug sequences and will most likely hit together.\nUnlocking and flashing of a nRF5340 (two M33 cores) already works, but we are missing a few changes to the core library which will have to be made to finalize this addition.\nNot part of this PR, but closely related and under development as well is SWD v2 Multidrop support. This will enable us to flash chips like the RaspberryPI Pico. While a useable fork already exists, some work is still left to integrate this properly into the probe-rs core.\nHardware Based Testing\nWe have recently merged a great addition by @Tiwalun to improve testing of our PRs in the form of a smoke testing tool in the main repository.\nYou can set it up to test each PR against the devkits you own. This will catch many regressions and errors before we can merge them into master.\nTo step this one up, we have worked on a custom hardware rig which will allow us to do large scale automated testing of each PR on a set of N targets multiplexed against M debug probes.\nA sneak peek of the rig's design can be seen below ;)\n\nTo push this project a little further, we have put up a posting for a BSc thesis with a local technical university (Switzerland). If you are a BSc student and would like to work on this, feel free to reach out to @Yatekii no matter of locality. We cannot promise anything but we will try to figure something out to make this work!\nVarious\nhs-probe\nWe announced the hs-probe quite a while ago. Many of you have ordered one already. Unfortunately the manufacturing was hit by the global chip shortages as well. The good news is that manufacturing has concluded today and the probes now go into programming. This means we can start the shipping of the probes soon!\nEmil has been working really hard to make this a possibility and get the probe manufactured even during chip shortages!\nIf you have not ordered a probe yet, and would like to get ahold one, you can do so on our shop.\nAutomatic Releases\nWe now have a pipeline set up to automate releases of the probe-rs core library and related crates. This should allow us to release way more often so your own tools do not have to pull from master constantly.\nAt the start we are aiming for approximately one release every two weeks. This is an experiment and we will see how it goes. We believe that we should bring new functionality and especially fixes to you as soon as possible.\nAlongside more releases I'd like to try to blog a little more about the ongoing development and curiosities we encounter. Though, to focus more on development and user support we will keep this promise as small as possible for now ;)\nSponsoring\nWe put a lot of work into probe-rs, because we believe in it being an important cornerstone to the embedded development ecosystem.\nAll of this is voluntary work and we continue to work on it voluntarily, but during times when life at our day-job is a little more stressful it can become hard to spend the evening putting in extra work hours, which is why we set up a sponsorship option.\nAt this point, thanks a lot to all of our sponsors that already contribute a great deal to probe-rs' continued development and support!\nIf you love probe-rs and want to see it grow and prosper, we would love if you considered [sponsoring] probe-rs development. Some of us would love to at least work part time on the project to speed up its development and improve the quality of our tooling. Additionally, as explained above, we have big plans for hardware based testing to ensure the highest possible quality software, which will impose some monetary cost of course.\nYou can do so through Github or OpenCollective.\nprobe-rs in Production\nWe have heard of a handful of companies that are using or going to use probe-rs in production to provision their devices. This excites us very much and reassures that we are actually making a change in the embedded ecosystem!\nThank you!\nThanks a lot to all of our users &amp; sponsors that show us that our work is appreciated.\n","id":"https://probe.rs/blog/release-0-11-0/","title":"0.11.0 Released! 🎉"},"https://probe.rs/blog/release-0-12-0/":{"body":"Hi everyone!\nAfter two long weeks we are back with the release of 0.12.0.\nWe have had a lot of development on various fronts on which I intend to give an overview down below.\nprobe-rs\nWe have two huge new features in probe-rs which do not seem like much from a regular user perspective but actually enable us to implement a lot of additional functionality down the road.\nFirst of all we finally merged Sequence support. There is only one target (namely the LPC55S69) which has custom sequences, but there are a lot more chips which can profit from this to do chip-unlock, multicore, special reset sequences and much more.\nThe second bigger thing is multicore support and DPv2 support. While multicore is pretty much self explanatory, DPv2 support enables us to select a DebugPort, which enables us to do Multidrop SWD. This is a not so much used functionality, but while it's cool to have anyways, it is required to support the RPi2040, which has one DebugPort for each core instead of one for both, which regular multicore targets do.\nAlso, for proper multicore support on all targets, many of them will need to implement sequences to unlock additional cores, which is not implemented for most of them yet.\nA big thank you for this goes to Dirbaio and diondokter.\nApart from that we added various smaller things that make developer life easier; to see what changed, please have a look at the CHANGELOG.md.\nVSCode\nOur VSCode plugin is included in this release. While it surely still is rough around the edges, it is definitely useable and I encourage all of you to give it a shot so that we can identify all the issues and make it even better. @noppej and recently @Tiwalun too have been hard at work to provide you with a good debugging experience. Thank you!\nYou can find more info around using the plugin in the Repo and on our Guide.\nHardware Based Testing\nBehind the scenes, our newest crewmember, @TeyKey1 has been very hard at work for his BSc thesis to make large scale HW testing for probe-rs a reality.\nYou can find all the info around the designs in the repo.\nThe design has been revamped from last blog's sneakpeek and is now oriented a bit differently. Previously I tried to make the design to fit as many possible targets and probes as possible and due to hardware and monetary constraints, the design disregarded runtime. So in the old design if we actually tested a lot of targets it would result in immense testing times because the design could not multiplex well. Additionally, the old design was not suitable to be built for every dev so they could test at home - even if they'd put less targets on the test.\nSo the new design takes all of this into consideration. It features a compact build with a bit less possible targets and probes: 4 probes and 32 targets can be tested with 4 tests at once being possible - one on each probe. The design features a RaspberryPi 4 as a base and stacks shields with chip daughterboards on top.\nThis enables everyone to design a daugtherboard which can be manufactured and included in the test-rig. If we need more than 4 probes or more than 32 targets, we can assemble a second rig - all at a very low cost of manufacturing with a very modular design.\nThe project itself is split into two parts. The first (this autumn semester) aims at making a testrig with a basic firmware to have the hardware working and tested. At the moment it looks like this will be done in time.\nThe next semester will be the second part, where Thierry will work on doing nice integration of the testrig with Github, automate everything to run on new PRs, write tests for the targets and test out all the daughterboards he designed.\nIf you have any wishes or ideas for the daughterboards or the tests to be performed, please voice them and we'll see if they can be included.\nI am very stoked for this especially, as it enables us to make changes more fearlessly and test things very well!\nAutomatic Releases\nWhile this time the release was less than 2 hours work and thus more pleasant, we still did not manage to cut an earlier release. We will try on in the future to improve this ;)\nhs-probe\nWe have shipped many hs-probes - 166 to be precise - over the last few months. Very exciting!\nFor me personally, this has been a very unpleasant experience due to difficulties with shipping things to various locations on the planet. I put in many many more hours than I ever planned and in the end it would have been easier to do all the shipping myself.\nMost likely I wont be doing this again.\nI hope all the hs-probe owners are happy with their probes :)\nIf you are still waiting on a stuck order, please contact me. Unfortunately my possibilities here are limited. Most shipping providers apparently do not report shipping status back properly and have very different requirements and delivery times based on country and shipping provider.\nAlso, we have a little stock left still and I am happy to send those out.\nThank you!\nThanks a lot to all of our developers, sponsors &amp; users that made this a reality and appreciate the work put in.\n","id":"https://probe.rs/blog/release-0-12-0/","title":"0.12.0 Released! 🎉"},"https://probe.rs/docs/":{"body":"","id":"https://probe.rs/docs/","title":"Docs"},"https://probe.rs/docs/community/":{"body":"","id":"https://probe.rs/docs/community/","title":"Community"},"https://probe.rs/docs/contributing/":{"body":"","id":"https://probe.rs/docs/contributing/","title":"Contributing"},"https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/":{"body":"","id":"https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},"https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/probe-setup/":{"body":"The probe-rs project supports three probes out of the box.\nMost of them require little to no setup.

Nevertheless, ARM hosts the CMSIS-Packs for pretty much any chip you'd ever want.\nCMSIS-Packs are ZIP files and contain arbitrary files. The exact structure is manufacturer defined and is\ndescribed in the .pdsc file being placed at the root level of the ZIP file.\nThe .pdsc file is a simple XML file containing all the meta information about the Pack.\nAlso inside the Pack - most of the time (they can be absent if the manufacturer chooses so) - are the flash\nalgorithms to flash the chips described by the Pack.\nThose are the .FLM files, which are plain old ELF binaries adhering to a certain defined structure.\nFlash Algorithms\nA flash algorithm is a simple program that is executed. It consists of a fixed set of (sometimes optional)\nfunctions which get loaded into RAM and are executed by the flash downloader.\nThose functions are described here.\nThe same specification also describes the metadata that is stored inside the\nELF binary itself as a debug symbol and inside the .pdsc file.\nBoth, the loadable ELF symbols, as well as the metadata are required to assemble a fully functional flash\nalgorithm. This is the job of the flash downloader.\nThe functions follow standard ARM EABI calling convention.\nYAML format\nSince the Packs are full of bloat we don't need, we have introduced a slimmed down format for target\ndescription.\nWe chose YAML to represent the target as it is a well known format and allows comments.\nEvery YAML file adresses an entire family of chips equivalent to the CMSIS-Packs.\nThe yaml format follows the following structure:\n---\n# The name of the chip family.\nname: string\n# A list of all the chips in the family.\nvariants:\n  # The name of the chip.\n  - name: string\n    # A list of all the available memories and their properties.\n    memory_map:\n      # The type of the memory.

As a dev this is needed if you implement your own probe. More about this in the chapter about implementing your own probe.\nBest is to list the connected probes and open the one you like. Most likely there is one only anyways.\n// Get a list of all available debug probes.\nlet probes = Probe::list_all();\n\n// Use the first probe found.\nlet probe = probes[0].open()?;\n\nNow you can access all the functionality a probe can offer. Not all probes offer the same functionality, which is why some calls may return a negative Result.\n// Perform a hard reset of the connected target via the probe.\nprobe.target_reset()?;\n\n// Select the debug protocol.

Appart from passing a chip name, you can also pass various other arguments for selecting the chip.\nThe Session struct\nThe Session construct is an established connection of a Probe to a Chip.\nThe session can be used to list cores and attach to a core.\nIt can also read properties of the target and is used to facilitate some internal things.\nMost likely the only thing you'll ever use a Session for is attaching to a core.\n/// List and print all cores.\nlet cores = session.list_cores();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", cores);\n\n/// Attach to a core.\nlet core = session.core(0);\n\nThe Core struct\nThe Core is probably the struct you will interact most with.\nWith the core struct you can manipulate the CPU and it's accessible memories.\nIn the previous sections we have learned how we attach to a core. \nSometies you want to access the core operations in quick fashion. \nThis is what Session::auto_attach() is for. \nIt lets you attach to the Core without first opening a Probe. \nIt will try to open a connected prbe, and select the Core as best as it can\nlet session = Session::auto_attach(\"chip_name\")?;\nlet core = session.core(0)?;\n\nOnce you have attached to the Core, you are able to halt the Core at any point in time.\ncore.halt()?;\n\nThe Core::halt() call does not ensure the Core will actually halt.\nSo you might want to ask the core whether it has halted\nwhile let Ok(halted) = core.core_halted()? {\n    if halted {\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can single step the CPU on a per instruction basis\ncore.step()?;\n\nor just let the core run\ncore.run()?;\n\nAnd of course we can reset the core\ncore.reset()?;\n\nKeep in mind it sometimes has to run for the reset to work.\nThis is a soft reset and might come with kinks and quirks.\nCheck the Probe struct for a hard reset.\nOf course it's also possible to manipulate the CPU registers\nlet reg = core.read_core_reg(0x00)?;\ncore.read_core_reg(0x00, reg | 0x42)?;\n\nWe can also use hardware breakpoints\n// More often than not you will want to set a breakpoint.\ncore.set_hw_breakpoint(address)?;\n\n// But of course you can also remove the breakpoint.\ncore.clear_hw_breakpoint(address)?;\n\nOf course manipulating the CPU alone is not enough. Therefore it's also possible to access the memories that are phyiscally accessible by the CPU.\n// We can read a single word for the convenience of reading registers.\nlet value = core.read_word_32(address)?;\n\n// For reading flash contents you'll most likely want a block memory access.\nlet mut buffer = [0; 1337];\ncore.read_32(address, &amp;mut buffer)?;\n\n// Since reading alone is no fun, we can also write data.\nlet value = 42;\ncore.write_word_32(address, value)?;\n\n// And again, block-access.\nlet buffer = [0; 42];\ncore.write_32(address, &amp;buffer)?;\n\nprobe-rs handles batching for bigger memory requests and should optimize for maximum speed.\n","id":"https://probe.rs/docs/library/basics/","title":"Basic Usage"},"https://probe.rs/docs/library/crosscompiling/":{"body":"Even though probe-rs can run on most systems, there can be cases where using cargo install is not possible due to system permissions or resource limitations.\nIn such cases you can Crosscompile probe-rs for use in cargo-flash or cargo-embed on a different architecture, and move the resulting static binary to the target system.\nWe will use a Raspberry pi 400 as the target system as an example, where cargo install cargo-flash on a default Raspberry PI OS installation is not possible to pass the rustc final Linking step for probe-rs due to system memory limitations.\nAfter defining the target system architecture, in this example being armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf, here are two different ways to Crosscompile, each with their pros and cons.\nUsing Cross\nCross self defines as:\n\n“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates\n\nIts main advantage is to not be susceptible on the usual cross compilation issues that arise from using the host machine's shared object libraries, by using a Docker image to build the static binary.\nThe downside of this approach is that you will have to rely on the Cross Project and supply the build environment Dockerfile, making sure that it resembles the system you are building for with a cross C toolchain installed as much as possible.\nBuilding cargo-flash for the Raspberry Pi 400, on an x86_64 Linux System happens as follows:\n# Cloning cargo-flash on the system we will build the binary on.\ngit clone https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-flash\n\n# Installing cross\ncargo install cross\n\n# `cd` into the cargo-flash repository\n# And create a `crossimage` folder\ncd cargo-flash &amp;&amp; mkdir crossimage\n\n# Create a Dockerfile resembling the target system,\n# and put it inside the `crossimage` folder.\n\nWe can take an armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf base system from the rust-embedded/cross Docker Hub container registry.\nAfter that, follow the instructions from the probe-rs, cargo-flash prerequisites to prepare the image for the building steps.\nYou can download the Dockerfile for this example from here.\n# Create and edit a Cross.toml file in the root of the cloned repo.\nvim Cross.toml\n\nAdd the following to the Cross.toml.

This\nexample uses toml syntax to set each option under the default top-level profile key.\nThe Embed.toml should be part of the project, for local-only configuration overrides, you can\ncreate an Embed.local.toml (or .embed.local.toml) file and add that to your .gitignore.\nThe local files take precedence.\nProfiles\nThe data in the Embed.toml is structured in two levels: The outer layer is a configuration profile\nname, inside each profile there are then a series of sections with different options.\nThe default profile is called \"default\" ;)\nWhen invoking cargo-embed, a different profile name can be passed as an argument with --config &lt;profile&gt;, which will load the settings\nunder that profile instead of default.\nFor example, in your Embed.toml:\n[default.general]\nchip = \"STM32F401CCUx\"\n\n# No need to set this again, other profiles inherit from the \"default\" profile\n#[with_rtt.general]\n#chip = \"STM32F401CCUx\"\n\n[with_rtt.rtt]\nenabled = true\n\nNow you can run cargo embed --config with_rtt to have RTT enabled, while cargo embed will use\nthe default config \"default\" without RTT.\nRTT\nRTT stands for real time transfers and is a mechanism to transfer data between the debug host and the debuggee.\nIn it's essence it provides a configurable amount of ringbuffers, which are read/written by the target and the debug\nhost.\nThe protocol initially was published by Segger but there is really no magic to it other than ringbuffers being used.\nThis mechanism allows us to transfer data from the target to the host and vice versa really fast.\nRTT features:\n\nFast duplex data transfers\nA configurable amount of channels(buffers)\nChannels can be blocking and non blocking - your choice\n\nThis guide should get you going in no time to speed up your development with probe-rs.\nTarget\nFor the target side, we offer rtt-target, a small lib\nto set up the RTT structures in the target memory and read/write data from/to them.\nA minimal example of a host firmware would be\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\nuse microbit as _;\nuse panic_halt as _;\nuse rtt_target::{rprintln, rtt_init_print};\n\n#[cortex_m_rt::entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    rtt_init_print!();\n    loop {\n        rprintln!(\"Hello, world!\");\n    }\n}\n\nHost\nOn the host, just run\ncargo embed\n\nwith RTT enabled in the Embed.toml file.\nNow you should be able to see all the 'Hello World!'s in a default channel called \"Terminal\"!\n\nDon't panic!\nOf course it is easy to log all panics via RTT! Here is a most simple example of a panic handler:\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\nuse core::panic::PanicInfo;\nuse microbit as _;\nuse rtt_target::{rprintln, rtt_init_print};\n\n#[cortex_m_rt::entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    rtt_init_print!();\n    loop {\n        rprintln!(\"Hello, world!\");\n\n        for _ in 0..1_000_000 {\n            cortex_m::asm::nop();\n        }\n\n        panic!(\"This is an intentional panic.\");\n    }\n}\n\n#[inline(never)]\n#[panic_handler]\nfn panic(info: &amp;PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {\n    rprintln!(\"{}\", info);\n    loop {} // You might need a compiler fence in here.\n}\n\nAnd in the open rttui view you should see the panic.\n\nWe intentionally ship no default panic handler, so that you may choose the channel of your choice to log the panic\nto.\nSo how do I get more channels, you might ask. Read on!\nAll the channels!\nYou can define multiple channels via a provided macro as seen in this snippet\n#![no_main]\n#![no_std]\n\nuse microbit as _;\nuse panic_halt as _;\n\nuse core::fmt::Write;\nuse cortex_m_rt::entry;\n\nuse rtt_target::rtt_init;\n\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    let channels = rtt_init! {\n        up: {\n            0: {\n                size: 512\n                mode: BlockIfFull\n                name: \"Up zero\"\n            }\n            1: {\n                size: 128\n                name: \"Up one\"\n            }\n            2: {\n                size: 128\n                name: \"Up two\"\n            }\n        }\n        down: {\n            0: {\n                size: 512\n                mode: BlockIfFull\n                name: \"Down zero\"\n            }\n        }\n    };\n\n    let mut output2 = channels.up.1;\n    writeln!(\n        output2,\n        \"Hi!

You can switch to and from them with the F-keys.\nThe down channel will automatically be associated with the corresponding up channel and an input field will\nautomatically be displayed for channels with a corresponding down channel. This is done via the channel number, which\nmust be the same for the up and down channels. This is the default rttui behavior and can be configured. RTT itself can handle any up/down\nnumbers combination.\nNow you should be able to debug conveniently.

For details of current status and functionality please read this section.\nInstallation\n\n\nInstall the probe-rs-debugger extension in VS Code, by downloading the latest available probe-rs-debugger-x.x.x.vsix from the Releases page in our repo (we will publish to the Microsoft Extension marketplace when we exit the 'Alpha' phase of this project)\n\nInstall the downloaded extension file from the command line, for example:  code --install-extension probe-rs-debugger-0.3.3.vsix in the terminal\nAlternatively, \n\nTo generate the extension from source code...(if you wish to update the version distributed with this repository), please follow these instructions \n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the probe-rs-debugger server component, using instructions from probe-rs-debugger\n\n\nUsage and Configuration\nVisual Tour\nTo use the probe-rs-debugger extension for VS Code, you will need to configure a launch.json entry for your target project. \nWe recommend that you familiarize yourself with the VSCode debug process, and specifically the section that discusses the differences between launch and attach request types.\nThe configuration choices may differ based on your use case, as demonstrated in the following examples:\n\nStart a debug session, by launching a new process on your target device.\nStart a debug session, by attaching to an existing process on your target device.\nStart a debug session (either form above) against a remote debug server process running on a server on a specific TCP/IP address and port.\nUsing RTT to transfer data (e.g. logs, and println) between VSCode and your target application\n\nMany of the entries in launch.json are optional, and the values for each are described in the hover tips. When values are restricted, the allowable values are available through VS Code intellisense.\nA minimum configuration would look something like this (required customizations are indicated with //!MODIFY tags )\nStart a debug session with minimum configuration\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"preLaunchTask\": \"${defaultBuildTask}\",\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs Executable Test\",\n            \"coreConfigs\": [\n                {\n                    \"programBinary\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"chip\": \"STM32H745ZITx\", //!MODIFY\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThe following fully configured examples can be used (with customizations to reflect your own project and chip) to help you get started.\nUsing the launch request type\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs Executable launch example\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n            \"connectUnderReset\": true,\n            \"speed\": 24000, //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"probe\": \"PID:VID:&lt;Serial&gt;\", //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"probe-rs-debugger\",\n            \"runtimeArgs\": [\n                \"debug\"\n            ],\n            \"coreIndex\": 0,\n            \"flashingConfig\": {\n                \"flashingEnabled\": true,\n                \"resetAfterFlashing\": true,\n                \"haltAfterReset\": true,\n            }\n            \"coreConfigs\": [\n                {\n                    \"programBinary\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"chip\": \"STM32H745ZITx\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"svdFile\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                }\n            ],\n            \"consoleLogLevel\": \"Info\", //Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace \n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nUsing the attach request type\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs Executable launch example\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n            \"speed\": 24000, //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"probe\": \"PID:VID:&lt;Serial&gt;\", //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"coreConfigs\": [\n                {\n                    \"coreIndex\": 0,\n                    \"programBinary\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"chip\": \"STM32H745ZITx\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"svdFile\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                }\n            ],\n            \"consoleLogLevel\": \"Info\", //Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace \n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nUsing to an existing probe-rs-debugger server\nTo start probe-rs-debugger as a standalone server:\nprobe-rs-debugger debug --port 50000 # Replace the value 50000 with any available TCP port number\n\nThen use the following launch.json to connect to it:\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"preLaunchTask\": \"${defaultBuildTask}\", //Configure a default build task for 'cargo build'\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs Server attach example\",\n            \"server\": \"127.0.0.1:50001\", //!MODIFY ... can be a server that is remote from the VSCode session, but local to the probe \n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n            \"speed\": 24000, //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"probe\": \"PID:VID:&lt;Serial&gt;\", //!MODIFY (or remove)\n            \"coreConfigs\": [\n                {\n                    \"coreIndex\": 0,\n                    \"programBinary\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"chip\": \"STM32H745ZITx\", //!MODIFY\n                    \"svdFile\": \"Relative or fully qualified path to your programBinary\", //!MODIFY\n                }\n            ],\n            \"consoleLogLevel\": \"Info\", //Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace           \n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nConfiguring RTT to transfer data\nprobe-rs-debugger and the VS Code extension supports using RTT in your target application.\nFor more information on how to configure your target application to use RTT, please refer to the instructions under the cargo-embed\nsection of this guide.\nIn order to capture the RTT output in the VSCode extension, you will need to supply additional entries to your applications launch.json entry. You can use the following example and modify the channel information to match the rtt-target channel configurations in your application.\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs rtt-target example\",\n            \"coreConfigs\": [\n                {\n                    \"coreIndex\": 0,\n                    // ... &lt;snip&gt; ...\n                    \"rttEnabled\": true,\n                    \"rttChannelFormats\": [\n                        {\n                            \"channelNumber\": 0,\n                            \"dataFormat\": \"String\", // Format RTT data as String data\n                            \"showTimestamps\": true  // Include host-side timestamps for every line of data transferred from the target RTT output\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"channelNumber\": 1,\n                            \"dataFormat\": \"BinaryLE\" // Treat data as raw binary data, and do not format in any way\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nIn addition to supporting RTT channels with rtt-target, we also support using the defmt (a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, and supports complex formatting and RUST_LOG-like logging.)\nWhen using defmt, we can configure the client side based on what is captured in your application, and the launch.json only requires a single additional entry.\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"probe-rs-debug\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"probe_rs rtt-target example\",\n            // ... &lt;snip&gt; ...\n            \"rttEnabled\": true,\n            // \"rttChannelFormats\": [ //!OPTIONAL\n            //     {\n            //         \"channelNumber\": 0,\n            //         \"dataFormat\": \"Defmt\",\n            //     }\n            // ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nNOTE: Using RTT along with low power modes has some limitations. Frameworks such as embassy and rtic uses low power by default and this can cause RTT to not produce any output on some devices. In some cases, this can be overcome by configuring your device to enable the RCC DMA clock before entering low power.\nNOTE: When using defmt RTT, please keep the following limitations in mind.\n\nDue to the way the defmt crate works, it is currently not possible to mix defmt and rtt-target channels in a single application.\nThe defmt crate always uses channel number 0 for its output.\nThe defmt crate introduced a new log filter that filters out log statements at build time. To ensure your defmt logging is not default filtered to error level, you can either add the environment variable in your .cargo/config file, or add the options setting of your tasks.json (see below), to match your desired logging level on the target.\n\nAdding DEFMT_LOG to cargo/config\n[env]\nDEFMT_LOG = \"info\"\n\nAdding DEFMT_LOG to launch.json\n// ... &lt;snip&gt; ...\n  \"options\": {\n    \"env\": {\n      \"DEFMT_LOG\": \"info\" //!MODIFY: Remove or use any of the supported DEFMT_LOG options.\n    }\n  },\n  \"tasks\": [\n// ... &lt;snip&gt; ...\n\nTIP: When using RTT, the data is streamed into a terminal window on a per channel basis. If your application uses multiple RTT channels, you may want to consider using the new VSCode Terminal tabs setting.\nCurrent working functionality and known limitations\n\n\nLaunch: Start a debug session on the target by (optionally) flashing the target firmware.\n\nAttach: \n\nBy default, VSCode will manage (start/stop) the probe-rs-debugger process to facilite a debug session against a target process.
